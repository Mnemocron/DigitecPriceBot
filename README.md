# Price Bot

This is a tiny pricecrawler that can be run once a day on a server for example.
The links of the input file are working for products of the two online shops [Digitec] and [Galaxus].

> digitec and galaxus are online shops from the swiss company [Digitec Galaxus AG]

## Input
New product links can be added to the digitec_urls.txt in the INPUT folder.
## Output
The OUTPUT folder contains a .txt file for each product.
## Run the Bot
The program is configured that way, if the price was already updated on the same day, no changes will be applied to the output files.

## Graphs
You can use Microsoft Excel or something like that to create graphs of the prices.
